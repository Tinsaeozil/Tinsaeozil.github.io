        The Integrated Design Process (IDP) is a method of intervention in early stages of the design
        process that supports the development and design team to avoid sub-optimal design solutions.
        IDP is not a new concept, and may in fact have been applied in the past by some design teams
        on an ad-hoc basis; but the formal implementation of the process is a development that has
        taken place over the past 15 years. This paper provides a partial history and some analysis
        of the characteristics of IDP. The C-2000 Program One source of specific information on a
        formal implementation of IDP is the experience gained from a small Canadian demonstration
        program for high-performance buildings, the C2000 program, which was developed and managed by
        Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), with the author as developer of the requirements and manager
        of the process.

    <h2> BRINGING ARCHITECTURE TO LIFE</h2>

    <p>
        Design of a building which considers architecture, structural engineering, passive solar
        building design [1] and HVAC. The approach may also integrate building lifecycle management
        and a greater consideration of the end users of the building. The aim of integrated building
        design is often to produce sustainable architecture.[2]
        Design of both a product (or family of products) and the assembly system that will produce it.
        Design of an electronic product that considers both hardware and software aspects, although this
        is often called co-design (not to be confused with participatory design, which is also often
        called co-design)
