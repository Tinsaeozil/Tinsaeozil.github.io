        The Integrated Design Process (IDP) is a method of intervention in early stages of the design
        process that supports the development and design team to avoid sub-optimal design solutions.
        IDP is not a new concept, and may in fact have been applied in the past by some design teams
        on an ad-hoc basis; but the formal implementation of the process is a development that has
        taken place over the past 15 years. This paper provides a partial history and some analysis
        of the characteristics of IDP. The C-2000 Program One source of specific information on a
        formal implementation of IDP is the experience gained from a small Canadian demonstration
        program for high-performance buildings, the C2000 program, which was developed and managed by
        Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), with the author as developer of the requirements and manager
        of the process.
